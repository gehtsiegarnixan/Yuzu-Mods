## Overview

This is a modified verion of the [32.9 Super Ultrawide mod for 2.0.0 from victoria4dx](https://github.com/victoria4dx/switch-mods/raw/main/Captain%20Toad:%20Treasure%20Tracker/1.3.0/01009BF0072D4000/32.9%20Super%20Ultrawide.zip). I changed the FOV so in 2-player splitscreen is displayed correctly on 32:9 screens. Thanks to [fruithapje21](https://www.reddit.com/r/yuzu/comments/qfgqdi/is_there_a_60fps_mod_for_mario_kart_8_deluxe_4/) for pointing out the updated address.

I don't mind if you reupload, modify, update, or do whatever with the files. Have fun!

To install both or either of the mods:
1. Download the mod you wish to install linked in the [Downloads section](#Download)
2. right-click Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in Yuzu and select "Open Mod Data Location".
3. Then move the downloaded mod zip file there. Extract the zipfile here.
4. If you open the new folder it should contain a folder called "exefs".
5. Return to Yuzu and right-click Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and select "Properties".
6. You can enable or disable the mod in the "Add-Ons" tab. **Only one of the 32:9 mods can be active at a time, because they edit the same value.**
7. **Enable the "stretch to window" function in your emulator for this mod to work properly.**

## Play splitscreen using multiple monitors

You don't need a 32:9 monitor for this mod to work. You can join two 16:9 monitors to act like a single 32:9 monitor 
So in two-player split screen mode, each player gets a monitor to themselves, or in 3,4-player mode everyone gets half a screen. 

If you have an Nvidia GPU, use [Nvidia Surround Display](https://www.nvidia.com/content/Control-Panel-Help/vLatest/en-us/mergedProjects/nv3d/To_configure_my_displays_for_Surround.htm). It is just a setting in the Nvidia control panel, no need to install anything.

If you use an AMD GPU, try AMD's [Eyefinity](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/eyefinity).
